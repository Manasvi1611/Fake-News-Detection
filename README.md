# Fake-News-Detection
Our project focuses on applying various machine learning approaches and comparing         them to classify whether a news is true or false . After importing the data, plots will be  used to analyze it. The Techniques like RNN and Algorithms like LSTM are used. The accuracy of the model using Some of the Machine Learning algorithm will be  calculated. Then the one with a good accuracy is taken as the model for detecting the fake news .
